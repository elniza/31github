# SETUP

1. Open project folder in vsCode
   - I recommend finding the file folder in explorer/finder. Open a new vsCode window with nothing in it. Drag and drop the folder from explorer/finder into vsCode.
2. Make sure you have live-server vsCode extension.
   - In vsCode, on the left there should be 5+ icons along the side of the screen. Click on the icon with 4 boxes, search live-server, and install.
   - [Link to live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
3. In vsCode, open the exercises folder you are working in.
4. Right click on index.html and "open with live-server"
   - This should open a page in your browser with red test sections.
   -
   - As you pass the tests they'll turn orange (for partial) and green (for complete)
5. Open the code.js file in vsCode, it should have some comments, and maybe some starter code.
6. Follow the instructions in code.js. As you write code, and save, the tests in the browser will pass.
7. Continue until all tests are green.
   - If you encounter difficulty, be sure to use google.
   - If google doesn't help you make any progress in 10-15 minutes (any progress at all!), then reach out to a classmate, TA, or teacher for help!
   - Handing in a partial assignment is better than getting stuck. If you find one problem isn't making progress, work on the other ones! Progress, not perfection!
